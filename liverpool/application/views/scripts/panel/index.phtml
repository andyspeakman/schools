<p><br>Polly Brannan is Education Curator at <a href="http://www.biennial.com/2016">Liverpool Biennial.</a>
She is an artist and educator who has produced projects at Frieze Art Fair, Lisbon Experimenta Festival
and Nottingham Contemporary, amongst others. She was Collaborations Curator at Studio Voltaire from 2006-9,
and Education Curator at Serpentine Gallery from 2011-13. She is co-founder of network Avant Gardening,
and was a member of the collective public works from 2005-11.</p> 

<p>For the 9th edition of Liverpool Biennial
2016, a curatorial team has been assembled to work together, sharing different interests and expertise,
the team of curators includes Polly who will be leading on the Children’s Episode where artists are
invited to consider children as the primary audience: sometimes making work with them, sometimes for them.
Children imagine the space between fiction and reality differently, sometimes seeing it as the same thing.
This will be an occasion to explore a fictional universe invented by children for artists, and realised
by artists for children. Liverpool Biennial will also be working with Childwall Academy and The Studio
school to create online learning resources, interpretation and exhibition guides for children.</p>

<p><br>Susan is a past president, member of council and member of the professional development board of NSEAD,

The Big Draw.</p> 

<p>She says: “I am totally absorbed in the world of art craft and design education, 
as artist, teacher, adviser, and critical friend and as part of NSEAD. Nationally (and beyond) 
I am a campaigner and advocate for the subject. I strongly believe that every child has an entitlement 
to a high quality visual art education and will do all that I can to remind people of that. 
I agreed to be a judge for this because it is a chance to showcase and to celebrate all the 
wonderful work being done in schools by teachers and young people. I can't wait to see the art work.”
