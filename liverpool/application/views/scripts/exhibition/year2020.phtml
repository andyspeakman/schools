<p>After the sadness of having to postpone our 8th annual dot-art Schools exhibition due to the coronavirus pandemic, we are thrilled to be able to 
hold this dot-art Schools virtual exhibition so that the creative work of children and young people from our participating schools can still 
be shared and celebrated online. We'd like to say a HUGE thank you to Arts Council England for making this possible.</p>

<p>Following a judges' shortlist and an online public vote, the 2020 exhibition showcases the winning work 
from each of our 76 participating schools. The overall winners of the 2020 dot-art Schools Competition were announced at a 
our first VIRTUAL prize-giving ceremony on Zoom, on 7th July, where the top three 
students from each of the participating schools in the Liverpool City Region were also celebrated.</p>


<p>You can also watch the recording of the virtual prizegiving - you will need the password: <b>8h=x32k!</b></p>
