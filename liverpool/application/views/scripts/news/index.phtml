    <p><b>dot-art Schools has commissioned graphic artist Thom Isom to produce this fantastic poster, which is FREE to download
    (click the image) and will also be posted out to secondary schools across the Liverpool City Region.</b</p>
    
    <p><b>Thom worked with groups of creative industries professionals, recent graduates, current students and the general public
    to find out what barriers exist to working towards a creative career, why and how people choose to study creative
    subjects and the huge advantages this can bring. The result is this inspirational image, highlighting the huge number of 
    jobs in the creative industries (which is the fastest growing sector in the UK) and just some of the reasons why working
