The Year 5 were exploring landscape art and were inspired by the artist Rozanne Bell to produce their own landscapes. The children focused on mixing and blending primary, secondary and tertiary colours to create similar backgrounds that feature in a lot of Rozanne's landscapes. We found using and mixing water colours was most effective medium to achieve this. After this, the children looked at perspective in order to try and replicate the flower imagery that appears close up to the viewer with the background in the distance.
